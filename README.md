# Secret_Sender
University project in 2014 using concept of Visual Cryptography and Matlab

Every system of field in todayâ€™s world requires security. Sending confidential images through the internet is very risky as there is no guarantee that the images sent are secured. For this purpose we have devised a system called `Secret Sender` which allows the user to send confidential images to other users by making use of encryption and decryption techniques. These techniques are used to secure the image from an unauthorized user.
